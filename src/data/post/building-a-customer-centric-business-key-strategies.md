A **customer-centric approach** means putting your customers at the heart of your strategy, products, and services. Businesses that focus on customers see higher satisfaction, loyalty, and long-term growth.

### 1. **Understand Customer Needs**

To deliver real value, you need to know your customers inside and out.

- Conduct surveys and interviews

- Personalized thank-you messages

These initiatives make customers feel valued and appreciated.
