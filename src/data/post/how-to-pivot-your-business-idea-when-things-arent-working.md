## How to Pivot Your Business When Things Aren’t Working

Sometimes, even the best business ideas don’t work out as planned. However, failure doesn’t have to mean the end. By pivoting, you can adjust your strategy or product to meet new market demands. Here’s how to pivot effectively:

### 1. **Identify the Problem**
Determine why your original idea isn’t working. Is it a product-market fit issue, competition, or customer feedback?

### 2. **Assess New Opportunities**
Look for trends, gaps in the market, or customer pain points you can address. Conduct fresh market research to identify viable options.

### 3. **Test the New Idea**
Before fully committing, test your pivot idea with a small MVP or pilot. Collect feedback to determine if this direction is worth pursuing.

### Conclusion
Pivoting is a crucial skill for entrepreneurs. If things aren’t working, it’s important to remain flexible, assess new opportunities, and adapt to customer needs. A pivot can lead to success, even if the original idea doesn’t.
